IDEA:
Make a virtual chicken game

PLANS:
(1.2) Different types of food fill it up more
(1.4) Have feeders that can be bought at the store for feeding the chickens
(3) Allow the purchasing of more chickens
(4) Make the need to buy food and water if you have more than x chickens
(5) Upgrade the chickens using money gained from buying eggs
(6) Make housing for the chickens so they live longer/lay more/don't get eaten
(7) Allow the purchasing of items and upgrades
(7.1) Change the main loop to have a main state and a store state
(7.2) Add the feeder item
(9) Create savefile so that you can resume progress

DONE:
(1) DONE: Make it so that you can take care of a chicken by giving it food and water.
(1.1) DONE: Clicking on the chicken will feed and water it
(1.3) DONE: Make them move
(2) DONE: Enact some sort of egg collection so that you can sell the eggs. eggs are laid when the chicken stops moving. make it so when the chicken is more full it will move more often and shorter distances.
(8) DONE: Change the egg laying so that when the chicken is full it will lay more eggs
