IDEA:
Make a virtual chicken game

PLANS:
(1) Make it so that you can take care of a chicken by giving it food and water.
(1.1) Clicking on the chicken will feed and water it
(1.2) Different types of food fill it up more
(2) Enact some sort of egg collection so that you can sell the eggs
(3) Allow the purchasing of more chickens
(4) Make the need to buy food and water if you have more than x chickens
(5) Upgrade the chickens using money gained from buying eggs
(6) Make housing for the chickens so they live longer/lay more/don't get eaten
(7)
