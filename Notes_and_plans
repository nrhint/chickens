(1.2) Different types of food fill it up more
(2) Enact some sort of egg collection so that you can sell the eggs
(3) Allow the purchasing of more chickens
(4) Make the need to buy food and water if you have more than x chickens
(5) Upgrade the chickens using money gained from buying eggs
(6) Make housing for the chickens so they live longer/lay more/don't get eaten
